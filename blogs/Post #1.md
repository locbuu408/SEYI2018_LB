Coming from a low-income area, not much is expected out of the kids in our residential area. Drugs and gang activity are common in our area, and it is only a few of many factors that leads to this low expectation. Due to this, many kids don't put in that effort to work against that expectation, and fall under the delusion of drugs and other activites that steer them off the path to success.  Although my area is not the legitimate “hood” and factors like gang-activity does not affect day to day life, it is still hard to stay unnerving when problems do arise.  I didn’t want to end up like the rest of the crowd, and this internship is my first step to my future. It’s a stepping stone to achieving my dream, an asset that will only help me flourish my passion for science.

Although it only being my first few weeks and a first-year intern at SEYI, it has already nurtured a sense of affection in me towards the people and this program. From the weekly get-togethers to our personal Biodiversity lab, I have already got the chance to do many activities I would otherwise have not have had the opportunity to do otherwise. It has already opened my mind so much as an individual set on pursuing science as a major and has allowed me to test the waters of the research aspect of a science career.

One major thing that is new to me this summer is reading scientific papers. Up to this point, I never really read a published scientific paper due to both lack of knowledge in those fields and no guiding figure to help me understand it. Even if I were to read it, I only have so much time on my hands with balancing homework, extracurricular, and watching over my siblings and cousins at home.

This does not give me much freedom to sit, ponder, and work through content that exists in science papers, as much as I want to. Being in that Biodiversity lab with Noel guiding us through the readings, I have already accumulated so much knowledge despite only reading 4 papers as of thus far. It really has opened my eyes to how not only technical, but expansive the science field can be. Although, I don’t think scientific papers are really my thing or strong suit per se. I know in the future that my career will sooner or later require me to write a scientific paper, I am more of a hands-on individual that enjoys fieldwork. Sitting all day is just not for me; doing this internship had helped me confirm my assumptions of whether I want to go to the more technical or field portion of science.

Another thing I really enjoy this summer is the labs. Since I was little, I always had a passion for animals, especially marine life. Whatever opportunity I got, it was always another chance for me to snatch a book about marine life from the local library to read. In our labs, Noel sets up stations and gives us questions to answer structured around these questions. Although it may tedious to some, I can’t get enough of working, observing, and learning about the fossils of the day’s lab. I can’t pick a favorite, but it has only become fuel to my passion for marine life.

One final thing that we did was get the chance to go to New Brightington Beach and UC Santa Cruz’s marine lab. This trip was great in many ways, from learning about the fossils embedded in the shell beds and cliffs to making

At the beach, my favorite thing to see was the whale fossils because it was just so amazing to think that I could get to see a part of an animal who lived so long ago. Although it was great to learn about all these fossils, the greatest part of this trip was getting closer to not only my fellow Biodiversity interns but to the other interns here working on different research projects.

On the car ride there and back, we played games, laughed, and got to know each other better which only added to the appeal of the trip. Overall, it was a trip that I will remember for a long time.
